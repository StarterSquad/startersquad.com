While delivering [software projects for startups](/projects), we've come to love AngularJS. We've also come to struggle
with clean modularity, both the parts that Angular does really well, and the parts that are somewhat missing. RequireJS
does a great job where Angular leaves some things to be desired, but using them together is not entirely trivial. What
 follows is our take at the problem.

## Why?
Working with Angular you could worry about a good way to organize code. There are already great how-tos on that, check
out [this mainly theoretical post][1] by Brian Ford and [this practical guide][2] by Cliff Meyers
if you haven't already. I'll share the way I'm managing code in Angular applications with RequireJS.

Continue reading if you want to:

- stop worrying about including script tags in the right order when building Angular apps;
- to load your javascript asyncronously;
- to compile code into single minified js file;

## Who?
I assume that you already know what AngularJS is and that you've at least heard of AMD and RequireJS. To illustrate the
approach I'll first enable RequireJS for [Angular Seed][3] and explain process. Angular Seed structures code by
splitting files by type and so will I. It's also possible to apply this approach if you write modules by entities
(you'll see it from `app.controllers` module implementation).

## How?

### Angular Seed Project
Let's check how Angular Seed structures code. Check out the
example [in your browser][4] or [on github][5] (copied from Seed):

- `app.js` file to bootstrap and set app config;
- actual implementation files - controllers, services, directives and filters;
- `index.html` with all script tags included in right order;
- or `index-async.html` that makes use of `angular-loader.js` and 3-rd party `$script` loader library to load
dependencies asyncronously.

Let's start the party.

### Add RequireJS
Checkout the example [in your browser][6] or [on github][7].

####  Installing dependencies
I used [bower][8] to do this for me.
See `bower.json` file:

{% highlight json linenos %}
{
  "name": "AngularJS + RequireJS Example",
  "version": "0.1",
  "main": "index.html",
  "ignore": [
    "**/.*",
    "libs"
  ],
  "dependencies": {
    "angular": "~1.0.8",
    "requirejs": "~2.1.8",
    "requirejs-domready": "~2.0.1"
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Put the `.bowerrc` file next to `bower.json`, run `bower install` and - poof, we have all we need under `libs` folder.

#### index.html
Destruction is a good start. Open Angular Seed's `index.html` and remove all the `<script>` tags. Looks cleaner,
doesn't it? Now switch to creation mode and add single script before closing `</body>` that will load RequireJS
and instruct it to look for config in `js/main.js` with the [data-main attribute][9]:

{% highlight html linenos %}
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <title>My AngularJS AngularJS + RequireJS App</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/app.css">
</head>
<body>
  <ul class="menu">
    <li><a href="#/view1">view1</a></li>
    <li><a href="#/view2">view2</a></li>
  </ul>

  <div data-ng-view></div>

  <div>Angular Require seed app: v<span app-version></span></div>

  <script src="lib/requirejs/require.js" data-main="js/main.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
{% endhighlight %}

That's all there's to it. You can close `index.html` now, as there is nothing more we need to add to it.

#### main.js
Time to setup RequireJS config.

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
require.config({

	// alias libraries paths
    paths: {
        'domReady': '../lib/requirejs-domready/domReady',
        'angular': '../lib/angular/angular'
    },

    // angular does not support AMD out of the box, put it in a shim
    shim: {
        'angular': {
            exports: 'angular'
        }
    },

    // kick start application
    deps: ['./bootstrap']
});
{% endhighlight %}

What just happened? In [paths][10] we set aliases for the libraries and plugins used, then we defined that angular
should be [shimmed][11] and that `bootstrap.js` should be loaded to start the application.

#### bootstrap.js
We're bootstrapping angular manually now, that's what bootstrap.js is for.
Note that you don't need `ng-app` in your html anymore.
Also `routes.js`, which contains angular routes configuration is included into dependencies list.

Note that in this require module we almost have no use of asynchronous loading
and we'll always have chain of angular -> app -> routes, as they depend on each other:
angular needs to be present on a page before setting up application module, which is required to exist when defining routes config.

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
/**
 * bootstraps angular onto the window.document node
 */
define([
    'require',
    'angular',
    'app',
    'routes'
], function (require, ng) {
    'use strict';

    require(['domReady!'], function (document) {
        ng.bootstrap(document, ['app']);
    });
});
{% endhighlight %}

We use [domReady][12] RequireJS plugin to make sure that DOM is ready when we start the app. Note that before doing so
we're loading the `app.js` dependency, in there the main application is defined.

#### app.js
`app.js` wraps the definition of the top-level app module and loads the dependencies of its submodules.

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
define([
    'angular',
    './controllers/index',
    './directives/index',
    './filters/index',
    './services/index'
], function (ng) {
    'use strict';

    return ng.module('app', [
        'app.services',
        'app.controllers',
        'app.filters',
        'app.directives'
    ]);
});
{% endhighlight %}

We agreed to have 4 modules by files types: controllers, directives, filters, services - we require these modules
to be loaded before defining the main module.

#### routes.js

Top level routes definition lives here. It is also possible to have modules to set up their own routes
(this case is omitted for now in favour of simplicity).

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
define(['./app'], function (app) {
    'use strict';
    return app.config(['$routeProvider', function ($routeProvider) {
        $routeProvider.when('/view1', {
            templateUrl: 'partials/partial1.html',
            controller: 'MyCtrl1'
        });

        $routeProvider.when('/view2', {
            templateUrl: 'partials/partial2.html',
            controller: 'MyCtrl2'
        });

        $routeProvider.otherwise({
            redirectTo: '/view1'
        });
    }]);
});
{% endhighlight %}


#### Module structure
A module consists of 3 parts:

- definition;
- component;
- loader.
  
Let's use the `app.controllers` module as example.

#### module definition (`controllers/module.js`)
It's just like top level `app.js`: it defines a module.

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
define(['angular'], function (ng) {
    'use strict';
    return ng.module('app.controllers', []);
});
{% endhighlight %}

This file will be used by the module components to attach themselves to (see next section).

#### module loader (`controllers/index.js`)
That's just an empty define block with all module components included. You don't need to mention `module.js` here as it's already required by components. Loader is included as dependency of top level `app` module. And that's actually how RequireJS knows about files to load.

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
define([
    './my-ctrl-1',
    './my-ctrl-2'
], function () {});
{% endhighlight %}


#### module components (`controllers/my-ctrl-1.js`)
In the case with the `app.controllers` module it'll be controllers. Example of controller wrapped in define is:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
define(['./module'], function (controllers) {
    'use strict';
    controllers.controller('MyCtrl1', [function ($scope) {}]);
});
{% endhighlight %}

Note that we used reference to `./module.js` to attach component to its module.


## Conclusion
That's it. Now you have working Angular application powered by RequireJS. You can enjoy the power of not tracking
the order of your scripts anymore and you get some powerful minification tooling to boot.

In next articles I'll show you how to test this application properly, how to compile it into single file and
automate workflows with grunt. All this is already enabled in [StarterSquad Angular + Require Seed][13]
check it out if you can't wait (I'm a slow typist).
